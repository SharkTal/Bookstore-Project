# HLG Bookstore

Visit live deployment at https://hlgbooks.com

## Overview

This project is an online bookstore that focuses on selling eBooks. For the payments we are using PayPal server-side integration. We are also implementing user control so that a registered users can have access to the books they have bought. Users will also be able to write reviews and give ratings on books.

## Software
### Backend
The backend is created with the FastAPI library in python because it is fast, easy to use and even creates automatic API documentation which makes the API much easier to understand. More about the backend in the [fastapi_backend folder](fastapi_backend)


### Frontend
For the frontend we are using react to hopefully simplify having multiple people working on it.
